In app >> Http we have Controllers, Middleware, Requests.
One of the main file is routes.php, in which we create and controll all the routs of the application.

In the config folder we have app.php where we register the classe we want to use from other providers, the plugins we want to use. We register them in this file. 
We also have the database connection file, which return an array.

The vendor folder contains all the packages we will install.


ROUTES

This files uses the static method Route::get, which takes the url we want to use and a function to return the view for this specific url.
You can pass parameters to the function by simply including them in the routes url, this way: '/example/{parameter}'

CONTROLLERS

Are "classes" that deals with information coming from databases and pass them to the view. And they can do also viceversa, taking information from the view and passing them to the model.
